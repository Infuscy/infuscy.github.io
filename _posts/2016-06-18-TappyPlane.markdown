description: This is my first game made in Defold. It is a clone made using assets from KenneyNL. The objective of the game is to obtain the highest score possible while a timer for the plane fuel shows how long you can stay up. Stars will give you a little bit of extra fuel. <a href="https://infuscy.github.io/TappyPlane/">Play Tappy Plane!</a>.
