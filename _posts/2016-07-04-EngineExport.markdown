client: Testing HTML5 export of various game engines
category: Game Development
description: I'm trying to decide on what game engine would provide the best HTML5 export.<br>So I've exported a project using different game engines:<br>    1.<a href="https://infuscy.github.io/DefoldExport/">Defold</a><br>    2.<a href="https://infuscy.github.io/export/">Unity</a><br>    3.<a href="https://infuscy.github.io/GMExport/">GameMaker Studio</a><br>I chose the engine using the criteria that it must export on multiple mobile platforms, to have an IDE and to allow to easily add monetization. The ranking of the loading times and sizes are: GameMaker (under 1s; under 1MB) < Defold (~2 s; ~2 MB) < Unity (~2 s + personal screen loading time.. a lot; ~3 MB). This surprised me a little as I was expecting that Unity will be a huge letdown but the engine made the game executable quite small and fast so I think there's a trick to it. All games run without any noticeable lag with Unity seeming to be the snappiest.<br> In the end..I'm still undecided.
